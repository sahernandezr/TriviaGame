#TRIVIA GAME

Website: https://sahernandezr.github.io/TriviaGame/

##HOW IT WORKS
You get 15 seconds to select one of three possible answers to the question shown.
After you select the answer, you get to know if you were right or wrong, and get to see a nice theme appropiate gif.
If you run out of time, you get to see your results: how many questions you got right, wrong or left unanswered. You also get a button to restart the trivia game.
